## Project Overview

This project aims to optimize traffic flow and improve ride-sharing efficiency in New York City by leveraging big data platforms. By analyzing traffic volume and ride-sharing data using scalable tools like Apache Spark and Hadoop, we provide strategic insights for better route planning and resource allocation.

---

## Dataset

We utilized the **New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)** trip record data, encompassing millions of taxi and ride-sharing trips. Key features include:

- **Trip Details:** Pickup and drop-off timestamps, locations, trip distances, and durations.
- **Fare Information:** Total fare, tip amount, payment type.
- **Geospatial Data:** Taxi zone lookup for mapping trips to specific NYC zones.


- [NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data (Parquet)](https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
- [NYC Traffic Volume Counts (CSV)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/)
- Location Zone Lookup Table

All data was stored and accessed via **AWS S3 Buckets** for scalability and cloud-based processing.

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Ingestion and Storage**
   - Loaded TLC datasets into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
   - Queried structured data using Apache Hive.

2. **Data Processing**
   - Used Apache Spark for scalable data transformation.
   - Cleaned and filtered raw trip records.

3. **Analysis**
   - Identified peak hours, high-demand zones, and traffic congestion patterns.
   - Evaluated ride-sharing opportunities based on route overlap.

4. **Optimization Strategies**
   - Proposed dynamic routing and clustering techniques.
   - Suggested demand-based pricing adjustments.

## Key Findings

- **High Demand Zones**: Midtown Manhattan and JFK Airport showed the most ride activity.
- **Ride-Sharing Potential**: ~30% of trips had overlapping routes within 5-minute intervals.
- **Congestion Patterns**: Weekdays between 5â€“7 PM had the highest traffic load.

---

## Recommendations

- **Dynamic Routing**: Use real-time congestion data for adaptive path planning.
- **Encourage Ride-Sharing**: Especially in dense zones like Midtown during peak hours.
- **Smart Pricing**: Implement dynamic fares to encourage off-peak usage.
